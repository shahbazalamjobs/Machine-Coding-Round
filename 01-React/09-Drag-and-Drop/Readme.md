Great question — you're thinking deeply about how index changes during a `splice` can affect the logic. Let's walk through it step by step and clarify **why this code still works correctly** despite removing an element first:

---

### ✅ Code Breakdown:

```js
const updatedItems = [...items];
const draggedItem = updatedItems.splice(dragIndex, 1)[0];
updatedItems.splice(dropIndex, 0, draggedItem);
setItems(updatedItems);
```

---

### 🧠 Your Concern:

> “After deleting the dragged item at `dragIndex`, won’t all the indexes shift? So when we use `dropIndex`, won't that place it in the wrong position?”

That's a **very intuitive concern**, but here's why it still works:

---

### 🔍 What Actually Happens:

#### Let's say you have this array:

```js
["A", "B", "C", "D"]
```

#### Suppose:

* `dragIndex = 1` (You're dragging `"B"`)
* `dropIndex = 3` (You're dropping it at position `3`, *before* `"D"`)

---

#### Step-by-step:

1. **Clone the array**:

```js
const updatedItems = [...items]; 
// ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
```

2. **Remove the dragged item**:

```js
const draggedItem = updatedItems.splice(1, 1)[0]; 
// draggedItem = "B"
// updatedItems = ["A", "C", "D"]
```

> Now, `"B"` is removed. Indexes have shifted.

3. **Insert dragged item at dropIndex**:

```js
updatedItems.splice(3, 0, "B"); 
// updatedItems = ["A", "C", "D", "B"]
```

> This **works as intended**: you're inserting `"B"` at index `3`, which is after `"D"`.

---

### 🧠 Why This Works:

The key is:
📌 **`dropIndex` is calculated from the original array** – but the way React handles events, **the drop target index you pass in still maps correctly**, because you're only modifying the array after you've received the drop event.

Even if the array changes in size (because you removed one element), you're not re-calculating or using dynamic indexes after the change. The drop index you captured in the closure or via `map()`’s `index` still holds up, **because it's based on the position of the drop target in the original render**.

---

### ⚠️ Only Time It Would Go Wrong:

If you were:

* Mutating the original array,
* Or calculating `dropIndex` **after** the splice,
* Or doing nested drag-n-drop with deeply changing structures,

Then yes, index mismatch could become a problem.

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

Your understanding is 95% there — the small trick is that the `dropIndex` is captured before any change is made, so the logic stays consistent. The index *does* shift internally, but we act before the render updates, so it's safe.
